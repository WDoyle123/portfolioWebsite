        <h2>About me</h2>
        
          I gained a passion for computers at an early age which lead me to become very tech saavy.
        
          I am always up to date with the latest technology and interested in finding out how it all works.
        
        <p>
          This pursuit was followed by a love for maths and physics. I completed my MPHYS at The University of Portsmouth.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          I have now immersed myself in the world of coding and continue to learn more about the topic.
